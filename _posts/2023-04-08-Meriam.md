# A Closer Look at impacts of Droughts and Heatwaves

As introduced in previos post, the focus of this analysis will be on the following two natural disasters: droughts and heatwaves. In this post, we will explore how these disasters affects as GDP, income, the total number of affected people and many more. By examining these relationships, we hope to gain valuable insights into the broader implications for communities and develop a better understanding of the complex interplay between natural disasters and socioeconomic contexts.

It is important to acknowledge that natural disasters do not discriminate based on geographic location or economic status. However, they tend to magnify existing inequalities, disproportionately affecting nations with limited economic resources. Countries grappling with poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and scarce resources face an uphill battle when addressing the effects of climate change.

To shed light on this, we will utilize scatter plots to visually represent the relationship between the magnitude these factors. Therefore, in the following post, we will analyze and interpret the collected data through scatter plots and perform a cluster analysis to identify potential patterns and relationships. The findings from this study will contribute to the ongoing discourse on climate change, natural disasters, and socioeconomic factors, ultimately fostering more resilient communities worldwide and supporting informed decision-making.

# Exploring the Connections: Analyzing the Data and Identifying Patterns through scatter plots 
Now that we have discussed the broader implications of natural disasters and their impact on socioeconomic factors, it is time to delve deeper into the data and uncover meaningful insights. In this section, we will analyze the collected information through the use of scatter plots and conduct a cluster analysis to identify potential patterns and relationships. 



The above scatter plot illustrates the relationship between GDP per capita and the total number of affected individuals, normalized for comparison purposes (log to log). It provides valuable insights into the relationship between GDP per capita and the total number of affected individuals. By examining the distribution of data points, distinct clusters emerge, revealing significant patterns and regional variations.

One notable cluster that emerges from the plot is situated in the corner characterized by the lowest GDP per capita and the highest number of affected individuals. Within this cluster, a predominant representation of African countries can be observed. This clustering suggests that nations in this region, grappling with limited economic resources, face significant challenges when dealing with the impacts of natural disasters. The concentration of data points in this cluster emphasizes the existing vulnerabilities and socio-economic disparities faced by these African countries.

Conversely, another distinct cluster becomes evident in the region characterized by high GDP per capita and a low number of affected individuals. This cluster is predominantly occupied by countries from Northern America, Europe, and Australia. The concentration of data points in this cluster highlights the relatively higher resilience and capacity of these nations to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters due to their stronger economic conditions, robust infrastructure, and better access to resources.

It is worth noting that the data points representing Asian countries are dispersed across the scatter plot, indicating a wide range of economic situations within the region. The scattered distribution suggests significant variations in GDP per capita and the number of affected individuals among Asian countries. This finding underscores the diverse socio-economic landscape in Asia, with some countries exhibiting high economic development and resilience, while others face greater vulnerability to natural disasters due to limited resources and infrastructure.

Overall, this scatter plot analysis underscores the intricate interplay between GDP per capita, the total number of affected individuals, and regional disparities in the context of natural disasters. It highlights the disparities in resilience and the need for targeted interventions to support regions with lower GDP per capita and higher vulnerability. 

In addition to exploring the relationship between GDP per capita and the total number of affected individuals, we further investigate the connections by examining the relationship between annual freshwater withdrawal and the total number of affected individuals. The scatter plot below provides a visual representation of this relationship.



I want the legend to have the same color as the other scatterplot, just so we dont get confused and the legend are not really wanting to be here either when using plotly to change the existing scatterplot evangelos made. 

The scatter plot depicting the relationship between freshwater withdrawal and the total number of affected individuals reveals interesting clusters and patterns. The data points on the plot are grouped together, indicating distinct regions with varying levels of freshwater withdrawal and the corresponding impact on affected populations.

In the left corner of the plot, we observe a cluster of data points representing African countries. These countries exhibit relatively low levels of annual freshwater withdrawal and are situated in a region where the total number of affected individuals is the highest. This finding suggests that inadequate access to freshwater resources in these African nations contributes to their vulnerability and susceptibility to the impacts of natural disasters. Insufficient freshwater availability can exacerbate the challenges faced by these countries in managing and recovering from such events.

On the other corner of the scatter plot, we find a cluster consisting of Northern American countries, certain Asian countries, and some European nations. This cluster represents regions with relatively higher levels of annual freshwater withdrawal and a lower number of affected individuals. The presence of these data points in this region signifies a greater ability to cope with natural disasters due to better access to freshwater resources. Northern America, with its advanced infrastructure and water management systems, along with certain economically developed Asian and European countries, demonstrate a higher capacity to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters through effective freshwater management strategies.

Situated between the African cluster and the cluster of Northern American, Asian, and European countries lies a mixed group of data points representing several European nations. This middle region reflects varying levels of annual freshwater withdrawal and corresponding impacts on affected populations. It suggests that within Europe, there are disparities in freshwater availability and resilience to natural disasters, with some countries demonstrating better resource management practices and more effective disaster preparedness.

# Introduction to Cluster Analysis: Exploring the Interplay of Socioeconomic Factors and Natural Disasters

As seen in the above section, there are relationsip between factors that are meaningful. In this section, we will delve into a comprehensive cluster analysis to uncover patterns and relationships among various socioeconomic factors and their association with natural disasters. The analysis will be based on multiple variables, including GDP, Cereal Yields, Annual Freshwater Withdrawal, Agricultural Land, Income, Disaster Subtype, Total Affected, and Population. By examining the relationships between these factors, we aim to gain deeper insights into the complex interplay between socioeconomic contexts and the impacts of natural disasters.

## Cluster 0:
This cluster consists of multiple countries, including India, Mauritania, Kenya, Egypt, Pakistan, and many others. The average year in this cluster is 2008.5. The average GDP per capita is approximately $7,986, with a wide range of values for various economic indicators. The cluster exhibits an average GDP contribution from the agricultural sector of 13.62%, while exports and industry contribute around 26.46% and 28.13% respectively. The average percentage of GDP spent on imports is 30.21%. The average annual freshwater withdrawal is 174.08 cubic kilometers, and the average agricultural land covers 41.44% of the total land area. The income distribution within this cluster shows that the highest 20% of the population earns approximately 48.62% of the total income, while the lowest 20% earns around 5.88%.
